MAPS the things to be noted and the 
=====================================

> it is not a subtype of the collection interface --> it has all its functions are different from that of the ones in collction 
> it is combination of the key and value pairs and here in order to fetch the values the keys need to be unique 
  anywhere there is relation which has to be made we need to go with this maps concept where we can easlily serach for the specific values we need just by using the 
  uinque key 

> the association with all the map classes to the MAP interface is given below 
 =========================================================
       MAP  <<<<<<<  Sorted map  <------ TreeMap	
            extends             implements

       MAP <-------  Hash map    <------ linked hash maps
            implements 		 implements   

 ==========================================================

> Since Map is an interface we will not be able to create the objects of that specfic interface 
> we need to create an object of [["Tree map , hash map , linkedhash map  "]] to override the methods which are in the map interface and some of the methods 
> since java 1.5 thre has been the introduction to the Generics which will help control the type of data that needs to be passed into the map 
> here the key has to be unique and the values can be of differnt or the same 
> here the key acts like a unique identifier that is used to find the specific value which is linked to it 
> some of the maps like the "linkedhash map and hash map" will allow you to store the key as null and also the values as well
> but Treemap does not allow you to store the values as null nor the key 


methods which are used in maps 
==============================
> clear() --> this is used to clear the entire key and values which are stored in the map

> containskey(object) --> this returns true/false if that perticular map a key which is mapped to some values --> it taked 

> containsValue(object) --> this is used to check if a value is mapped to more than one key so if it is mappped it will return true
